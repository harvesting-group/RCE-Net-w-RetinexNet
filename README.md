RCE-Net and RCE-Net w RetinexNet

RCE-Net and RCE-Net w RetinexNet are based on YOLOv8(https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) and RetinexNet(https://github.com/aasharma90/RetinexNet_PyTorch). RCE-Net is an end-to-end detection, segmentation, and ripeness network based on the yolov8.
RetinexNet is introduced into RCE-Net to alleviate the effects of various light intensities.
